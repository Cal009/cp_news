# CP | News

Welcome to my news blog. CP|News was created to allow users to post about their interesting stories whilst being able to have a discussion about it in comments. The News posts are usually kept more simple than regular news articles allowing the users to understand more about the content rather than a article filled with adverts or other random placeholder text used in most modern news articles.

## Aims of the website

### The main aim for the website:
As stated above somewhere for users to post about news articles they might have seen elsewhere and allows them to discuss them in the comments section below. Users can provide feedback to the posts by either leaving comments or simply liking or disliking the individual post. 

### Authentication
For the safety of the users, when a comment is submitted it has to be reviewed by an admin of the website. Not only this but the users are unable to comment or like without first signing in or signing up for an account.

## User Experience

### Visitors to this website are looking for:
- Somewhere to share their news posts
- The ability to comment on posts
- The ability to like or dislike posts
- The option to collaborate
- A sign in and sign out option
- Clear layout with eye catching content

## Existing features

### Home Page

- A clear layout is kept on the main website page with a small enough pagination of 6 posts per page. This allows for users to clearly see all the content on the page without having to continuously scroll. Next to each News article is an image related to the post itself that was chosen by the author of the article. If they do not wish to choose an image themselves then one will be inserted as a placeholder. This allows the site to maintain the same design allowing for a better user experience.
- A clear nav bar is in place at the top of the screen showing the Title of the Website, "Home", "About", and depending on if youre signed in or not it will either show the "Sign out" button or the "Sign up" and "Sign in" buttons. These buttons are hidden if the user is already signed in allowing for better user Experience. Alongside this there is a comment in the top left of the main page stating "You are logged in as (User)." This gives further reiteration that the user is logged in as the correct user.
