# CP|News

Welcome to my news blog. CP|News was created to allow users to post about their interesting stories whilst being able to have a discussion about it in comments. The News posts are usually kept more simple than regular news articles allowing the users to understand more about the content rather than a article filled with adverts or other random placeholder text used in most modern news articles.

## Aims of the website

The main aim for the website is as stated above somewhere for users to post about news articles they might have seen elsewhere and allows them to discuss them in the comments section below. Users can provide feedback to the posts by either leaving comments or simply liking or disliking the individual post. 

For the safety of the users, when a comment is submitted it has to be reviewed by an admin of the website. Not only this but the users are unable to comment or like without first signing in or signing up for an account.
